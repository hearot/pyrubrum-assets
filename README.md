## Pyrubrum Assets

The logo which represents Pyrubrum has been designed in order to give users all the information they need to understand the philosophy that lies in the project:

   - **Tree** - Pyrubrum makes use of data structures called [trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)).
   - **Red leaves** - Pyrubrum was originally developed to be integrated with [Pyrogram](https://github.com/pyrogram/pyrogram), reason being that the leaves, which link to the *tree*, are red.
   - **Text**:
      - *Py* in *Pyrubrum* is black, in order to keep the user think the project is developed exclusively for [Python](https://python.org).
      - *Rubrum* in *Pyrubrum* is red and represents the tree itself: it refers to [Acer rubrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acer_rubrum?oldformat=true), a common north american kind of tree. It is worth noting that an *Acer rubrum* has got red leaves.
